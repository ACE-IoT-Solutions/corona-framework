# Alignment Definitions between "Corona" OT Metrics and Common Information Model (CIM) Concepts (Draft)
#
# This file provides illustrative mappings using SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)
# to show potential conceptual alignment between Corona metrics and CIM concepts.
#
# WARNING: The CIM URIs used here (e.g., cim:ComDeviceStats.receivedBytes) are plausible examples
# based on general CIM structure but may not represent actual, standardized CIM properties.
# Consult official IEC TC57 CIM RDF schemas for definitive URIs.

corona:bytesReceived
    # Indicates a high degree of conceptual similarity
    skos:closeMatch cim:ComDeviceStats.receivedBytes ;
    rdfs:comment "Corona bytes received metric is conceptually similar to a potential CIM property tracking received bytes on communication device/interface statistics."@en .

corona:bytesSent
    skos:closeMatch cim:ComDeviceStats.transmittedBytes ;
    rdfs:comment "Corona bytes sent metric is conceptually similar to a potential CIM property tracking transmitted bytes on communication device/interface statistics."@en .

corona:packetsReceived
    skos:closeMatch cim:ComDeviceStats.receivedPackets ;
    rdfs:comment "Corona packets received metric is conceptually similar to a potential CIM property tracking received packets."@en .

corona:packetsSent
    skos:closeMatch cim:ComDeviceStats.transmittedPackets ;
    rdfs:comment "Corona packets sent metric is conceptually similar to a potential CIM property tracking transmitted packets."@en .

corona:broadcastPacketsReceived
    # Might be less common or grouped differently in CIM
    skos:broadMatch cim:ComPacketStats.broadcastReceivedCount ; # Example: broader match if CIM is less specific
    rdfs:comment "Corona broadcast packets metric might align broadly with specific CIM packet counters, if available."@en .

corona:errorPacketsReceived
    skos:closeMatch cim:InterfaceStats.receiveErrorPackets ;
    rdfs:comment "Corona error packets metric likely aligns closely with CIM properties tracking interface receive errors."@en .

corona:packetsDroppedReceived
    skos:closeMatch cim:InterfaceStats.receiveDroppedPackets ;
    rdfs:comment "Corona dropped packets metric likely aligns closely with CIM properties tracking interface receive discards/drops."@en .

corona:networkUtilization
    # CIM might model utilization differently, perhaps via related measurements
    skos:relatedMatch cim:CommunicationLink.utilizationMeasurement ; # Example: related match to a link measurement
    rdfs:comment "Corona network utilization may relate to specific CIM measurements associated with communication links or interfaces, rather than a direct attribute."@en .

corona:linkSpeed
	skos:closeMatch cim:ComMedia.speed ; # CIM often models communication media properties
	rdfs:comment "Corona link speed conceptually aligns with properties defining the speed of CIM communication media assets."@en .

# --- Mappings for Application Metrics ---

corona:readCommandLatency
    # Latency might be modelled as a performance measurement in CIM rather than a direct property
    skos:relatedMatch cim:ApplicationPerformance.averageReadLatency ;
    rdfs:comment "Corona read latency conceptually relates to potential CIM application performance metrics, possibly linked via MeasurementValue instances."@en .

corona:writeCommandLatency
    skos:relatedMatch cim:ApplicationPerformance.averageWriteLatency ;
    rdfs:comment "Corona write latency conceptually relates to potential CIM application performance metrics."@en .

corona:requestSuccessPercentage
    # Success rates might be derived from availability stats or specific counters in CIM
    skos:relatedMatch cim:CommunicationLink.availability ; # Example: related to link availability concepts
    rdfs:comment "Corona request success percentage may relate to CIM concepts of communication availability, reliability, or specific success/failure counters."@en .
