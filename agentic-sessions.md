# Agentic Sessions

## 2024-05-02: Multi-Format Output Support

Added documentation and implementation for multiple output formats to enable integration with various systems:

1. **TTL (Turtle) Format**
   - Primary semantic representation following the Corona ontology
   - Uses subject-predicate-object triples with RDF semantics
   - Maintains full relationship context between metrics and devices

2. **Project Haystack Formats**
   - Added JSON format support with row-based representation
   - Added Zinc format as a compact alternative to JSON
   - Implemented consistent naming conventions between Corona and Haystack

3. **Prometheus Exposition Format**
   - Added support for OpenTelemetry-compatible text format
   - Implemented counter metrics with `_total` suffix
   - Added type and help metadata as comments

4. **Format Translation**
   - Created consistent mapping between all formats:
     - TTL → Prometheus (e.g., `corona:globalWhoIsRequestsSent` → `bacnet_global_whois_requests_total`)
     - TTL → Haystack (e.g., `corona:globalWhoIsRequestsSent` → `metric:"globalWhoIsRequestsSent"`)
   - Maintained semantic equivalence across formats
   - Implemented data type transformations (XSD → JSON → text)

5. **Sample Outputs**
   - Added sample files demonstrating all formats
   - Created documentation with format comparison
   - Added examples showing the same metrics in different formats

## 2024-04-29: Enhanced BACnet Metrics Framework

Added new metrics to the Corona framework:

1. **Global Broadcast Metrics**
   - Added `globalBroadcastMessageCount` to track all global broadcast messages
   - Added `totalBacnetMessagesSent` to track total BACnet messages
   - Added `totalBroadcastsSent` to track all broadcast messages

2. **Enhanced WhoIs/WhoHas Services**
   - Maintained existing division of WhoIs into global and directed
   - Added new WhoHas metrics (both global and directed variants)

3. **COV Notification Tracking**
   - Added metrics for unconfirmed COV notifications (sent/received)
   - Added metrics for confirmed COV notifications (sent/received)

4. **Router and BBMD Metrics**
   - Added `messagesRouted` for tracking router activity
   - Added `messagesForwarded` for tracking BBMD activity

5. **Validator Improvements**
   - Enhanced validator with specialized analysis functions:
     - `list_broadcast_metrics()`
     - `list_cov_metrics()`
     - `list_who_metrics()`
     - `list_message_count_metrics()`
     - `list_bbmd_metrics()`
   - Updated ontology analysis to report on all new metric types

All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations while providing more granular tracking of BACnet protocol activities.

6. **Clarified `observedFrom` Property**
   - Enhanced documentation to clarify that `observedFrom` specifies the observer node (monitoring point) where metrics were collected or calculated
   - Updated SHACL shape descriptions to reflect this clarification
   - Made explicit that this is the device collecting the metrics, not necessarily the device being observed

7. **Added General Metric Properties**
   - Added `corona:description` for detailed metric instance descriptions
   - Added `corona:metric-identifier` for unique identification of specific metric instances
   - Added `corona:metric-name` for human-readable names for display purposes
   - Added validation rules with appropriate constraints
   - Enhanced validator with `list_general_metric_properties()` function
   - Updated example to demonstrate usage of these properties

## Session 2025-05-03: Pydantic Models, Serialization, and CLI

- **Goal:** Create Pydantic models for Corona metrics, implement serialization, and build a CLI.
- **Steps:**
    - Created initial Pydantic models (`BaseMetric`, `BacnetApplicationMetric`, `COVNotificationMetric`, `RouterBBMDMetric`) in `src/models.py`.
    - Implemented serialization methods:
        - `to_ttl()`: Initially used string concatenation, then refactored to use `rdflib` for robust RDF graph generation.
        - `to_haystack_json()`: Generates Haystack-compatible JSON.
        - `to_prometheus()`: Generates Prometheus exposition format text.
    - Configured `pyproject.toml`:
        - Initially used Poetry, then switched to standard `[project]` table with `setuptools` backend to support `uv` and standard packaging.
        - Configured for `src` layout.
    - Added `rdflib` dependency.
    - Created `src/demo_metrics.py` to generate sample metric instances.
    - Refactored `src/validate_model.py` to allow functions (`validate_model`, `analyze_ontology`) to be called as a library.
    - Developed `main.py` CLI using `argparse`:
        - `generate` command: Uses `demo_metrics` and `models` to create sample metrics and serialize them to TTL, Haystack, Prometheus, or JSON formats. Handles combined TTL graph output.
        - `validate` command: Calls `validate_model.validate_model`.
        - `analyze` command: Calls `validate_model.analyze_ontology`.
    - Debugged `NameError` in `main.py` related to missing `rdflib` imports (`URIRef`, `Literal`).
- **Outcome:** Successfully created a library (`src/models.py`, `src/demo_metrics.py`, `src/validate_model.py`) and a CLI (`main.py`) for generating, validating, and analyzing Corona standard metrics in various formats.

## Session 2025-05-03 (Continued): CLI Refactor, Testing, and Project Structure

- **Goal:** Refactor CLI, add validation tests, and improve project structure.
- **Steps:**
    - Added `click` dependency and installed it using `uv`.
    - Refactored `main.py` CLI from `argparse` to `click`.
    - Added `pytest` and `pyshacl` to dev dependencies.
    - Created `tests/test_validation.py`:
        - Generates demo metrics.
        - Serializes metrics to a combined TTL graph.
        - Validates the graph against `data/corona-shapes.ttl` using `pyshacl`, leveraging `data/corona-ontology.ttl` for RDFS inference.
    - Added a standard Python `.gitignore` file, including project-specific outputs like `demo.ttl`.
    - Restructured project layout:
        - Created `data/` and `examples/` directories.
        - Moved ontology and shapes files to `data/`.
        - Moved example TTL files to `examples/`.
        - Updated file paths in `src/validate_model.py` and `tests/test_validation.py`.
        - Removed redundant `if __name__ == "__main__":` block from `src/validate_model.py`.
        - Removed unnecessary `tests/__init__.py`.
    - Added `[project.scripts]` entry point (`corona-cli = "main:cli"`) to `pyproject.toml`.
    - Fixed Pydantic V2.11 deprecation warning in `tests/test_validation.py` by accessing `model_fields` via the class (`type(metric)`) instead of the instance.
- **Outcome:** CLI refactored to use `click`, automated validation tests implemented, project structure improved according to best practices, and deprecation warning resolved.
